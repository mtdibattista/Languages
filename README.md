KichwaGrammar (2022.12.17) v0.91

Presents a description of the grammatical features and organization of Kichwa, an indigenous language spoken in Ecuador.  All sections are complete except the final chapter that presents an atlas of sentence patterns for common statements.

A companion set of programs that analyze sentences following the spelling, word and grammar conventions of a regularized variety of the language -- so-called Unified Kichwa -- is mostly written, and will be uploaded soon.
